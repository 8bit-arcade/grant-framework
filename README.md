# EOS Network Foundation Grant Framework
Grant Framework Guidelines, Levels, Process, and Application

## Grant Guidelines
Individuals, small teams, and companies are all permitted to apply for grants. The purpose of the grants is to drive development of "[Public Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics))" for the EOS Mainnet community.  Grants [vary in size](#grant-levels) based on the size and scope of the initiative.  All forms of projects are open for submission, core chain modifications, tools, libraries, etc.  However, strong technical projects that clearly add to the Public Good are preferred.
The odds of getting your project approved increase if you follow our [acceptance recommendations](docs/acceptance-recommendations.md).  In all cases, you must meet the following [minimum requirements](docs/minimum-requirements.md).
## Grant Levels
The EOS Network Foundation (ENF) funds development grants for Public Goods for the EOS Mainnet network.  In the future, the ENF also plans to fund grants to “for profit” entities that will enhance the EOS community. Grants proposals are accepted in three levels, each having different amounts and acceptance criteria.  ENF Grants have guidelines, an application process, and a multi-stage approval process.  They also have a milestone based pay-out system.

## Grant Process

### Grant Teams
There are three teams that drive the process for ENF Direct Grants: Committee, Evaluators, and Operations

#### Grant Committee
The Grant Committee are senior members of the EOS community that know the priorities of the ecosystem and can make required initial funding decisions based upon the guidelines of the grant program.  This committee is more business focused than technically focused but they understand the technical nature of the desired future.

- Dafeng Guo
- Fu Pan
- Peter Watt
- Van Kai
- [Wen Huaqiang](https://github.com/orcoder) (might not be his github but looks possible)
- Damian Byeon

#### Grant Evaluators
The Grant Evaluators review applications approved by the Grant Committee for technical merit and achievability.   They are more technical in nature and are more concerned with whether the proposal solves the problem optimally, is realizable in the specified time frame, and utilizes proper processes as required for the milestone achievement metrics.
