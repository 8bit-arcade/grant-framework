## Project Overview

This application is in response to an RFP. (Open application process)

### Overview

The Lost Diamond is a real-world P2E adventure race where the goal is to find The Lost Diamond by conquering checkpoints all around the world.

This 90 second intro video will give a good overview: https://youtu.be/3BKr1uY6nZ8

The EOS Mainnet is the only technology platform available that has the requirements needed to make TheLostDiamond race work: 
- Instant transactions to anyone in the world
- No fees for the users 
- The option to transfer EOS-tokens to Coinbase/Binance to let the users spend the money earned by using a crypto debit card.
- The most user friendly tools (e.g. Anchor, Port, Bloks.io) 

Our team has been involved in EOS since 2018 and we want to contribute to the ecosystem's growth and teach non-tech people how blockchain technology can be used in a fun and educational way.


### Project Details

Our team has an ambitious long term commitment to make TheLostDiamond one of the most popular social platforms for outdoor activities, with millions of monthly active users.

150 million people are hunting virtual monsters on PokémonGo. By utilizing EOS, we have the opportunity and advantage to replace virtual monsters with real money in a new real-world adventure game that is fun and exciting for everyone. This is a great way to teach non-tech people about the EOS-ecosystem and the possibilities in web3 applications.

For people to adapt a new technology in mass, it needs to improve their lives by an order of magnitude. 
It’s not an easy task to motivate non-tech people to create an EOS-account, download and learn how to use Anchor sign-in or create a Coinbase account. It’s a steep learning curve.

TheLostDiamond solves this by having a $1,000 dollar lost diamond as incentive for participating. Also, the concept of a treasure hunt is fun and easy to understand for everyone. 

We will take a $7 dollar monthly subscription fee to participate and the smartcontract returns 80-90% back to the Play2Earn model to fund the lost diamonds. A true Web3 application where everyone can create, own and monetize their content.

We are aiming for 1 million users (0.65% market share from PokémonGo) within four years.

TheLostDiamond will be self-sustaining at 5,000 active users per month. 

Until we reach a self-sustaining level, we need to fund the $1,000 dollar lost diamonds from sponsors, grants, investors and/or entry fees from other single-event races. 

The current value of The Lost Diamond is $440 dollars. The Lost Diamond race is online, if you sign in with Anchor - and if you find The Lost Diamond, you and the checkpoint creator will both get $400 dollars - instantly paid out to your EOS-account.

Our first milestone is to prove that we can onboard participants to the MVP and obtain a 22% monthly growth rate over several months. Showing detailed traction is crucial for future funding from e.g. investors, sponsors, ENF and/or Pomelo. 

The first $1,000 dollar diamond will be announced in the beginning of May 2022 and will be self-funded. 


### Ecosystem Fit

The main goal of TheLostDiamond project is ecosystem growth.

The EOS Mainnet has solved one of the biggest problems in the world - how to transfer money instantly to anyone in the world as easy as sending an email.

The EOS-community needs ambitious projects that can show that advantage to a larger audience.  

The EOS Mainnet has 5 millions accounts. Important EOS-projects, e.g. the implementation of the EVM, are targeting the 20 million users in the Ethereum ecosystem. Our target audience is the 150 million users hunting virtual monsters on PockémonGo.

EOS has the opportunity and technology to replace virtual monsters with real money. And the EOS ecosystem needs projects that are targeting non-tech users in an order of magnitude from outside the smaller crypto community.

We are not aware of other similar real-world P2E adventure game projects in the EOSIO or other related ecosystems.

## Development Status

We have a working MVP that has been used for testing the application in several single-event races in Norway. https://cptblackbill.com/

The smartcontract is located on the EOS-Mainnet account cptblackbill. The code is available at https://github.com/bjornomsland/CaptainBlackBillSmartContract

The frontend is developed in NodeJs and hosted on Google Clouds. 

Different single-event races can have different unique domain names. E.g. our biggest single-event race is “Discover Oslo Adventure Race”. We will host our third Discover Oslo Adventure Race on June 11th. https://opplevoslo.app The feedback from our Discover Oslo participants has been exceptionally good. 98% say they will participate in the upcoming Discover Oslo race.

Development, testing and feedback from all the single-event races is the foundation for our main goal - launching The Lost Diamond 24/7 Global Adventure Race. The Lost Diamond 24/7 Global Adventure Race is ready for Test Marketing, where the goal is to find out how many people will participate in a pure crypto-based adventure race and see if we can obtain a 22% monthly growth rate. 


## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
