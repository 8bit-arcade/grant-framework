![8bitcryptotokenbuy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132336760/236186200-34095551-0e89-4b4e-8a69-989b4c34c65e.png)


### Overview

- **Name:** 8Bit Arcade, a gaming platform by the gamers for the gamers!
- **Brief Description:** 8Bit Arcade is a gaming platform and mobile App, primarily designed to incubate indie game developers. Our business model is based on multiple revenue streams: subscription, crowdfunding fees, royalties, advertising, ecommerce and partnership referral fees.
- **Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope:** We aim to onboard gaming projects into the web3 space with blockchain intergration via the EOS Network (GameFi and NFTs)
- **Reason for Interest:** We believe and know from market research that there is a demand for indie games in the web3 space, but there is no mobile ready testing and incubation facilities for independent game developers that can also provide real-time community feedback. We also, strongly believe in attracting 95% of the convetional gaming community into the web3 space through a positively subversive model. The future of gaming will be crowd driven, equitable, diverse and data driven; so at 8Bit Arcade, we are positioning ourselves to be at the forefront of innovation in the gaming industry which is currently experiencing a cultural shift from big gaming studio productions towards a more community and independent gaming development setup.

### Project Details

- Mock-ups/designs of any UI components
  -Please visit our website to view Early platform development and info on mobile App. https://8bit-arcade.com/  To enter the PoC pages click on the BLUE button on the holding page.
- Data models of the core functionality
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- We have run some market research of our own on our Discord server and Twitter account also.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - We are not, a for hire gaming design studio for indie game developers; we are a point of contact, for them, to showcase their IP and also a source for providing external services that may be required through our network of contacts. Within our Arcade there will be a space for games to be tested by our community, for this however there will be a minimum criteria that submissions will need to meet in order to be uploaded onto our server; so as such we will only be incubating project in their Beta phases or who can demonstrate an LITE version of their game in Beta phase.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - 8Bit Arcade will be the entry point for independent game developers wanting to enter the web3 space, we will onboard them and assist them where required with technical support, crowdfunding, in-game testing from our community and marketing through our social media outlets powered by our novel gaming highlight reel.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - Our audience will made up of two demographics: independent game developers and studios + an audience of gamers on the web and mobile devices.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - 8Bit Arcade is fullfiling a gap in the market for incubating independent games in their design & testing phases especially on mobile devices because this is where the majority of the market is heading and we can assist these start-ups in substancialy reducing their upfront costs in App development and market feedback whilst also supporting them with marketing.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOS Network / Antelope ecosystem?
  - Not that we are aware of at this point in time. Our closes competitor is: excilir and they are only a web3 gaming platform for RTM games.
- If so, how is your project different?
  - Ours offers an incubation facility, support for indie game developer where required, a mobile ready app for their games to be tested on by our community, future funding opportunities if appropriate, an offchain ecosystem for our web2 subscribers enabling them to interact with blockchain games on our platform, a bridge between web2 and web3 for our gamers but also for games as we will have some licensed titles in our arcade too.
- If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  - 'Game Starter' is an incubator in the web3 space, their offering is strictly tokenized and does not directly offer an arcade or gaming area for games to be tested/played, they only cater to web3 projects and gamers, thus, are focussing on a relatively small (5%) section of the market.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

## Future Plans

- How you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term?
  - Our PoC is nearing completion with frst couple of games due to be uploaded shortly, then after, we will concentrate on attracting more indie games to our platform on a FREE basis. We will be advertising in Reddit for game developers wanting to join our community and list their offerings; all of this will occure during the Beta testing of our platform. Simultaneously we will be negotiating licensing deals with gaming labels for certain titles to be hosted on our platform.
  - Towards July-August time we will have started to on-board subscription membership through our platform as a result of a targeted advertising campaign and collaborations with relevant gaming guilds.
  - Come September time we will aim to Go LIVE with the platform and subscription for our paid for service.
  - The core team will be attending gaming events in the web2 and web3 space to highlight our offering and promote our platform to an ever growing community of independent game developers.
  - Our founder regularly participated in Twitter spaces over the subject of gaming to voice our prescence and network within the sector.vWe will also be attending some trade shows towards the end of the yesr.
  - The founder is also currently seeking private funding to help with capital and ensure we have the necessary funds to bootstrap our roadmap moving forward over the next few years.
- The team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to the project?
  - To be the go to destination for indie game developers in the web2 and web3 space.
  - By the end of year one we would want to be able to host competitions and gaming meets with prize pools in collaboration with other platforms and gaming guilds.
  - In years 2-3 we would like to be in a position to establishing multiple prescences in key metaverse projects with an ARCADE and interoperable avatars, this would be an extention to our web-based platform and the next evolution of the project.
  - In year 4-5 we would like to be ready to franchise our brand and create the first 8Bit Arcade gaming HUB. Then branch our into key metropolitan cities around the globe.


## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Personal recommendation by Mell Pearce, Co Organizer @ EOS London. 

- FURTHER INFO ON OUR FAILED LAUNCHES: Although our governance token did launch eventualy, it was not succesful! We had a failed launch with PinkSale in February and then we only just got our token listed on a DEX and just scrapped in with a few dollars to spare at just over $1k when our unofficial soft cap was at $25k. Here is the link to failed pinksale listing: https://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/0x4F869E5d49783290Cb799b31DA907B317df2adb6?chain=ETH since the governance token has not generated any capital for us we are looking at Grants, Loans and private investments as a means to finance our development going forward. I feel this is important to clarify as it seems to be relevant to our case and your pre-requisits for successful grants.
