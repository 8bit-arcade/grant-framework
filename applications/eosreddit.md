## Project Overview

> If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful ENF grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

> Please provide the following:

- **Name:** EOS VISION x REDDIT AND FACEBOOK
- **Brief Description:** Welcome to EOS REDDIT 2.0, the new stage of EOS REDDIT, where we will be able to turn the old, lonely and depressed Reddit into a new way of reading the news and giving constructive opinions. Our trained team prepares to work on 3 Fundamental Pillars, offering a new face to Reddit, as well as providing new alternatives and attention to users with a misconception of EOS.
- Let's get ready to interact in all of Reddit in a respectful way, not only in the official EOS Reddit, trying to give a good marketing to what is being developed in EOS, reaching other Subreddits informing in a simple way developments, processes, improvements and projects that we have within the ecosystem.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** We prepare to promote the EOS and EOSIO community in the best possible way, with good marketing, as well as to demonstrate that the work that is done together between the blockchains has borne fruit and momentum to EOSIO. Reddit has an extensive number of users who will not hesitate to look at the information related to EOS AND EOSIO.
- **Reason for Interest:** EOS VISION proposes to support the EOS community on Reddit, which has 97.7k members, is being one of the largest EOS communities, it is also the one with the most FUD of all EOS, since a couple of years, It has been a bit abandoned, and has been recovering thanks to the team of EOS SUPPORT and EOS BEES. We have seen how necessary and important this social network can be to attract both new users and new projects, so we propose to support Reddit.

### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
We intend to use the reports, news, videos and other RELEVANT information found in the EOS COMMUNITY, and thus broadcast it on the social networks of Reddit and Facebook.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
We will support Reddit, but it will not be owned by us, EOS REDDIT and EOS Facebook is owned by the community and anyone can provide their services.
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious


### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOSIO landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Our project is in Ecosystem Growth, we hope to give good support to both EOS and projects, on Reddit and Facebook.
- Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our hearing is based on:
Journalists
crypto users.
New users on EOS and EOSIO.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
A new opportunity for reddit and facebook and using these networks that have many users are given the opportunity to learn more about EOS, its dApps, ecosystem and development in these social networks and show what is being created.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
  - Yes, currently some of the users within EOS post on Reddit, but not daily, EOS NATION and EOS SUPPORT post important details whenever needed. The difference of our proposal is that we intend to have Reddit active daily, with any relevant information.

## Development Status

> If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/grant-framework/tree/main/docs/rfps) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the EOS Network Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to the EOS ecosystem. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0c are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on someone else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Milestone Summary

> Note: the numbers in the three lines below are examples.  Please replace with your own calculations!  Then delete this instruction line.
> You **must** keep these three Milestone Summary lines below for your grant to be approved.  The Total Cost should add up to the costs
> of all of your Milestones.
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 12,000 USD

> Please note that this application is automatically parsed.<br/>
> For the above fields, please only put the answer on that line.  If you want to add more information, please put it below these instructions.<br/>
> Please remember to delete all lines that start with `>` as they are just instructions and not needed in the application submission.<br/>
> 
> Notes on above fields:
> - Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project (example: 2 months or 7 weeks)
> - Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): This is the average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), example: 2 FTE or possibly 2.5 FTE as it is an average)
> - Total Costs: This should be the requested amount in USD for the whole project (example 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#grant-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in EOS, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
